# Neural Architecture Search using Hill Climbing

##About##

This repository is about searching a suitable Convolutional Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm on Fashion MNIST Data-set.

*We are denoting each of the neural network using a genome sequence.
*We are trying to find out neural network with minimum paramater and maximum test accuracy.

## Hill Climbing ##
*Comeup with a fitness function
*Apply this fitness function to select the top 5 best genome sequence as per our fitness score.
