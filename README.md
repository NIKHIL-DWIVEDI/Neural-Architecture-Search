# Neural Architecture Search using Hill Climbing

## About ##

This repository is about searching a suitable Convolutional Neural Network using Hill Climbing Algorithm on Fashion MNIST Data-set.

* We are denoting each of the neural network using a genome sequence.
* We are trying to find out neural network with minimum paramater and maximum test accuracy(trade-off).

## Hill Climbing ##
* Comeup with a fitness function
* Apply this fitness function to select the top 5 best genome sequence as per our fitness score.

## Results ##
* Result for the best genome sequence found

* Training Accuracy Vs. Validation Accuracy and Training Loss Vs. Validation Loss for the best genome sequence.
